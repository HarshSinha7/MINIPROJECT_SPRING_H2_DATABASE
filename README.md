This mini_project is part of my comprehensive journey through the Spring Framework ecosystem.
It specifically focuses on the integration of H2 In-Memory Database with Spring JDBC Template for efficient data handling.

Key Features:
- Data Persistence: CRUD operations using JdbcTemplate with an H2 backend.
- User Management: Custom Sign-Up flow with validation and duplicate user checking.
- Integrated Spring Security for protected routes and authentication.
- Dynamic UI rendering using Thymeleaf and CSS.
